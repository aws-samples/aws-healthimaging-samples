## Description

This repository contains a C++ library and command line tool that performs high speed batch image frame retrieval from AWS HealthImaging. These can be used to rapidly download large data sets to support various workflows such as AI/ML training, AI/ML inference, image processing and visualization. This is helpful because existing applications are implemented in a variety of languages and runtimes many of which have limitations related to concurrent downloads and decompression that prevent them from fully utilizing AHI's performance.

## Status

This project is considered beta quality. All GA features are fully implemented with basic testing. Additional testing to verify the quality is occuring before moving it to GA.

This project is known to build on the following platforms:

- Mac OS X 13.6 (M1 Pro), Apple clang version 15.0.0, CMake 3.27.6. Use homebrew to install dependencies:
- Ubuntu 22.04.2 ARM64, g++ 11.4.0, CMake 3.22.1, nghttp2 1.43.0 and openssl 3.0.2

This project may require some tweaks for Windows builds

## Features

- Concurrent download of multiple image frames over multiple threads and multiple HTTP/2 connections
- Concurrent decoding of HTJ2K image frames with multiple threads after downloaded
- Callback design makes it easy to customize post download workflows (e.g. conversion to other file formats or file names)
- Includes callback implementations for common workflows (e.g. save ImageFrames to disk in HTJ2K (jph) or uncompressed (raw) formats)
- Design and implementation optimized for extremly high performance
- Library logging can be integrated with application logging system

## Building the CLI Application

### Pre-requisites

- C++ build tools that support [C++17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B20). Older compilers could probably be supported with minimal changes.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.22.1 or later
- [nghttp2](https://nghttp2.org/) version 1.43.0
- [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) version 3.0.2
- [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/) version 8.4.0
- [nlohmann-json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) version 3.11.3
- [cxxopts](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts) version 3.1.1

Note: Different versions of the above libraries may work but have not been tested

### Dependencies

#### Mac OS X

Use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```sh
brew cmake install libnghttp2 openssl@3 curl nlohmann-json cxxopts
```

#### Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install cmake libnghttp2-dev libssl-dev libcurl nlohmann-json-dev cxxopts
```

### Initilize git submodules

From the git repository root directory:

```sh
> git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Create build directory

```sh
> cd ahi-batch-image-frame-retrieve
> mkdir build
```

### Generate makefile with cmake

```sh
> cd build
# for Intel processors:
> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOJPH_DISABLE_INTEL_SIMD=OFF ..
# for non intel processors (ARM/Apple Silicon)
> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOJPH_DISABLE_INTEL_SIMD=ON ..
```

NOTE - OpenJPH currently features SIMD acceleration on Intel processors only. ARM is not currently accelerated with SIMD

### Build

```sh
> make -j
```

## Using the C++ Library

This C++ library is built using [modern cmake](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/) principles. This means you can add this git repository as a submodule, include it in your project using cmake add_subdirectory() and link to it using target_link_librar(${APP_NAME} ahi-retrieve-lib). See the cli application for an example of using the C++ library. Note that you can create your own ImageFrameDownloadCallback implementation to control the post download workflow (e.g. decode the image frame and copy the result into the memory buffer of another runtime such as NodeJS or Python)

## Using the CLI

ahi-retrieve takes as input one or more [JSON documents](docs/input.md) as input files. These input files describe the ImageFrames to download from AWS HealthImaging. ahi-retrieve will download all image frames in parallel for each input file using the configured download threads and download connections. Once an ImageFrame is downloaded, the format parameter describes whether or not to save the HTJ2K encoded (jph) files to disk or to decompress them first (raw). Each ImageFrame is saved as a separate file with the imageFrameId followed by the format extension (e.g. 7a9d6d62177792250da227bd2815ef7c.raw or 7a9d6d62177792250da227bd2815ef7c.jpc). These files are stored in a directory structure in the current working directory which includes the datastoreId and imageSetId. For example:

169224ef14db49839f628fb887d50291/d91be0830da6a8550ddef2491cf1f10b/7a9d6d62177792250da227bd2815ef7c.raw

ImageFrames are always downloaded and saved overwriting existing files of the same name if they exist. It is up to the caller to manage deletion of the ImageFrame files.

## Performance Tuning

You can achieve very high download rates (saturate a 1Gbps residential internet connection, > 5Gbps
from an EC2 instance) with this library. They key is to take advantage multithreading and HTTP/2 request multiplexing.
The actual download performance varies based on bandwidth and cpu power. Latency only impacts the time to first image
but does not impact aggregate bandwidth with appropriate concurrency settings. To tune your download performance,
adjust each of the following settings in order:

1. Number of concurrent requests per connection.
2. Number of connections per thread.
3. Number of download threads.

The default values for each of these in the CLI is relatively low. Increase the setting for each of the above
until no further benefit is achieved, then go to the next setting. For example, if increasing the number of concurrent requests does not yield any further
speed benefit, start increasing connections per thread. Once connections per thread yields no benefit, try increasing
the number of download threads. At some point you will either saturate your bandwidth or CPU in which case no further
performance gains will be possible.

NOTE - As of Nov 8, 2023, performance does not scale up beyond ~20 concurrent requests/connection and connections
are dropped if the number is too high. We recommend staying below 20 concurrent requests and increasing the
number of connections and threads accordingly. Higher numbers of concurrent requests/connection may be
possible in the future.

HTJ2K decoding is extremely fast and the default of 10 decode threads should generally keep up until download
rates exceed 4 Gbps and large datasets (e.g. > 1GB uncompressed size)

## TODO

- Add more error handling
- Add more logging
- Add support for verifying the ImageFrame CRC checksum
- Add support for decoding with Kakadu library
- Add support for getting aws credentials in other ways (e.g. ~/.aws/credentials, STS)?
- Add support for generating Nifti volumes as an output format?
- Consider switching from polling to events?
- Consider configuring libcurl to use shared ssl keys?
- Explore ways to presize the decode buffer size smarter (currently hard coded to 256k - perhaps Content-Size HTTP Header?)
